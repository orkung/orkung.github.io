it's a social networking protocol. think of it as a language that describes
social networks: the nouns are users and posts, and the verbs are like, follow,
create, share...
ActivityPub seperates content from platform. Posts from one platform propagate
to other platforms, and users don't need to make sepereate accounts on every
platform that they want to use.
