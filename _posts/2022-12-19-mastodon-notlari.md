Tip: If you are using Mastodon, you may want to set the first toot to "Public" and all the rest to "Unlisted". This way people looking at Public timelines will only see the first toot in the thread and aren't confused by seeing other parts before that.
When they click on the first toot they will see the whole thread. Followers will
still see all toots in their Home timeline.

alias account: Profile moves can only be initiated when your two accounts have
been aliased. Account aliases are currently not used for anything other than
profile moves, where you will need to set your old account as an alias of your
new account before initiating the move. Setting aliases is harmless and
reversible on its own.
