## What is Quarkdown?

Quarkdown is a tool designed to make writing structured
documents easier and more efficient. It builds upon the
simplicity of Markdown but adds powerful features that allow
you to create complex layouts and content with minimal effort.
Think of it as Markdown on steroids!

Whether you're a student, a writer, a developer, or anyone who
needs to create well-organized documents, Quarkdown can help
you streamline your workflow.

## Why Use Quarkdown?

You might be wondering, "I already use Markdown. Why should I
switch?" Here are a few reasons why Quarkdown is worth a look:

* **Simplicity:** At its core, Quarkdown is just as easy to
  learn as Markdown. If you're already familiar with Markdown,
  you'll feel right at home.
* **Power:** Quarkdown introduces new concepts that let you
  create layouts like columns, callouts, and more, directly
  within your document.
* **Extensibility:** Quarkdown is designed to be modular,
  allowing you to add new features and functionalities as
  needed.
* **Focus on Content:** By handling the layout and structure
  for you, Quarkdown lets you focus on what matters most: your
  content.

## Getting Started with Quarkdown

Getting started with Quarkdown is easy. The official
documentation at
[quarkdown.com/docs](https://quarkdown.com/docs) is the best
place to find detailed information about installation and
usage.

For a quick start, you can refer to the project's [README](https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown) on GitHub.

## Core Concepts

Quarkdown introduces a few key concepts that set it apart from standard Markdown.

### Boxes

The most fundamental concept in Quarkdown is the **box**.
Everything in Quarkdown is a box. A box can contain text,
images, or even other boxes. This simple idea is what gives
Quarkdown its power and flexibility.

### Functions

Quarkdown uses functions to create different types of content
and layouts. For example, to create a two-column layout, you
might use a `columns` function. These functions are easy to
use and understand, even for beginners.

Here's a simple example of how you might use a function:

```mdx
[row] {
  [col] {
    ### First Column
    Content for the first column.
  }
  [col] {
    ### Second Column
    Content for the second column.
  }
}
```

This simple syntax uses a `row` function to create a container and two `col` functions for the columns, placing their content side-by-side.

## Common Usage Examples

Let's dive into some more practical examples to see how you can use Quarkdown's functions to build your document.

### Creating a Callout Box

You can create styled boxes for notes, warnings, or tips by combining `box` with styling functions like `background` and `padding`.

```mdx
[box] {
  [background "#FFFBEB"]
  [padding 16]
  **Note:** This is an important piece of information that you want to stand out. You can use regular Markdown formatting inside.
}
```

### Adding an Image with a Caption

You can use the `image` function to embed images and combine it with other boxes for alignment and a caption.

```mdx
[center] {
  [image "A beautiful landscape from Unsplash"] "https://source.unsplash.com/random/800x600"
  // A simple text box below an image can serve as a caption.
  [text] "A random image from Unsplash."
}
```
